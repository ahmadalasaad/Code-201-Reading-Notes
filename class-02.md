# HTML

## Text

In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that appears on your pages. You will learn about:

* Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
* Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such  as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something  you have written 

is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

### Headings

HTML has six "levels" of headings
``` 
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>
 
```

```<h1>``` is used for main headings

```<h2>``` is used for subheadings

If there are further sections  under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on..

### Paragraphs

``` <p> ```

To create a paragraph, surround  the words that make up the  paragraph with an opening ```<p>```

tag and closing </p> tag.

*By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.*

### Bold & Italic

```<b>```

By enclosing words in the tags ```<b>``` and ```</b>``` we can make characters appear bold.

The ```<b>``` element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a 

paragraph) although the use of the ```<b>``` element does not imply any additional meaning.

```<i>```

By enclosing words in the tags ```<i>``` and ```</i>``` we can make characters appear italic.

The ```<i>``` element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content â€” such as 

technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.

### Superscript & Subscrip

```<sup>```

The ```<sup>``` element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts

 like raising a number to a power such as 2^2.

```<sub>```

The ```<sub>``` element is used to  contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical 

formulas such as H2O .
